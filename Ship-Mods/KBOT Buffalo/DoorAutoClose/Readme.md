# Buffalo adjustable Door Auto Close

* Create a Field "DoorCloseWait" in the MemoryChip (bottom right rack) holding the number of seconds you want the door to stay open
* Exchange DoorClose Script by DoorAutoClose.yolol (Bottom Chip, Left Rack)
* Optionally rename one of the EngDoor-Buttons to "Maint". If "on" the doors will stay open for working on ship etc.
